<!--
!!!caution
    Check the list of potential risks associated with the use of Dogechain zkEVM in the  section.

-->

Users can deposit assets from Ethereum and transact off-chain on Dogechain zkEVM. For moving assets across chains (L1 &harr; Dogechain zkEVM), you will need to use the Dogechain zkEVM Bridge. The bridge interface is available for both Mainnet Beta and Testnet in the [Polygon Wallet Suite](https://wallet.polygon.technology/zkEVM/bridge).

<!-- The next video is a guide on how to bridge tokens from L1 to the Dogechain zkEVM Testnet. The same video applies to the Dogechain zkEVM Mainnet.
