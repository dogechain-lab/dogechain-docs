# Doginals / PawPort Bridge FAQ

## What is DRC20? 

DRC-20 is a token standard on the Dogecoin blockchain that allows developers and users to create fungible and nonfungible assets within Dogecoin's ecosystem. 

These Dogecoin Ordinals, or 'Doginals', are a fairly new functionality for Dogecoin, adding utility to the OG meme blockchain asset. 

In a nutshell, they enable developers or users to write (inscribe) information stored on the smallest individual units of a Dogecoin (aka 'shibes'). 

## What is Dogechain? 

Dogechain is an EVM-compatible Layer-2 of Dogecoin. It provides DOGE holders with a platform to use their assets as gas and access smart contract capability for Dogecoin. 

In short, users can bridge their DOGE on Dogechain to plug it into the growing Web3.

## What is DOG20?

DOG20 is the token standard of the EVM-Compatible Dogechain blockchain. This standard allows for the creation and transfer of tokens built on Dogechain, such as $DC, $WDOGE, $FUCKPEPE, $KIBBY, $TDH, $WOJAK, $DTOOLS, etc. 

Consequently, the bridged DRC20 inscriptions from Dogecoin will have their DOG20 counterpart on Dogechain. 

## What is the difference between DRC20 and DOG20?

- DRC20 are inscriptions that store additional data on the Dogecoin network, allowing to mint fungible and nonfungible assets on the smallest individual units of a Dogecoin. They are different from ERC20 and DOG20 tokens as there are no smart contracts involved in the process. 
- DOG20 is the EVM token standard on Dogechain, providing smart contract capability to bridged DRC20 inscriptions.  

## Why should I bridge DRC20 on Dogechain? 

DRC20 assets are an incredible step forward for Dogecoin’s network utility. However, they still have shortcomings and cannot be practically plugged into Web3 applications. 

Additionally, when trading DRC20 assets on marketplaces such as drc-20.org, you need to set specific limit orders with a predetermined amount of assets to list them on the marketplace. This makes trading DRC20s illiquid and inflexible. 

Bridging DRC20 to Dogechain will allow you to access more liquid markets and trade them on the large list of decentralized exchanges on Dogechain. In addition, this will allow you to imbue your DRC20 with more utility and smart contract capabilities, to be added in blockchain games, dApps, and other Web3 applications. 

Finally, you would be contributing towards higher scalability of Dogecoin by alleviating the strain on the underlying blockchain. 

## What is the PawPort Bridge?

The PawPort Bridge is the first Dogecoin cross-chain bridge that allows you to port DRC20 tokens onto the EVM-compatible Dogechain. It provides access to smart contract capability for your Dogecoin-based assets by converting them to DOG20 tokens. 

## How does the PawPort Bridge work?

On a base level, the PawPort bridge receives inscribed DOGE with your DRC20 tokens and stores them in cold storage. 

At the same time, it mints their DOG20 counterparts on Dogechain, sending them to the EVM wallet of your choice. 

To this end, the Dogechain PawPort bridge uses the drc-20.org indexer that allows it to keep track of the inscriptions on Dogecoin. 

## What do I need to bridge DRC20 on Dogechain?

1. A DRC20-compatible wallet like [Doge Labs Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/doge-labs-wallet/jiepnaheligkibgcjgjepjfppgbcghmp?hl=en) to interact with the Dogecoin blockchain. 
2. An EVM-compatible wallet like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) to interact with the Dogechain blockchain. 
3. Some DRC20 assets and DOGE on Dogecoin for transaction fees. 
4. Some wrapped DOGE on Dogechain for transaction fees. You can bridge DOGE to Dogechain [here](https://dive.dogechain.dog/bridge). 

## How do I bridge DRC20 assets from Dogecoin to Dogechain?

To bridge a DRC20 asset on Dogechain: 

1. Connect your Dogecoin and Dogechain wallets to the PawPort bridge
2. Select the route Dogecoin >> Dogechain in the PawPort app. 
3. Select the desired DRC20 asset you wish to bridge onto Dogechain and click “Transfer”
4. The bridge will attempt to detect whether you have any transferable inscriptions in your Dogecoin wallet for the selected asset. 
5. If needed, create a new inscription with the desired amount of DRC20 assets and wait for it to appear on the bridge. This process can take between 15-20 minutes, depending on the congestion of the Dogecoin network. 
6. Once the bridge detects your transferable inscription, select the tokens and click “Confirm”. This transaction will require some DOGE on Dogecoin. Sign the transaction in your Doge Labs wallet. 
7. Visit the “[History](https://bridge.drc.dogechain.dog/account)” page and wait for your DRC20 token to be transferred to the bridge. 
Once it become available, you will be able to click on the “Mint” button and send the newly minted DOG20 token to the EVM wallet of your choice. 
8. How do I bridge DRC20 assets from Dogechain to Dogechain?

## Connect your Dogecoin and Dogechain wallets to the PawPort bridge

1. Select the route Dogechain >> Dogecoin in the PawPort app. 
2. Select the desired DRC20 asset and the amount you wish to bridge out of Dogechain.  The bridge will detect whether you have any DOG20 tokens corresponding to the DRC20 asset you selected. 
3. Paste the Dogecoin wallet address where you want the DRC20 to be sent and click “Transfer”. This transaction will require some wrapped DOGE on Dogechain. Sign the transaction in your EVM wallet. 
4. Visit the “[History](https://bridge.drc.dogechain.dog/account)” page and wait for your DRC20 token to be transferred to the address.  

## How do I change the amount of tokens I want to transfer to Dogechain? 

When prompted, select “New Inscription” to create a new batch of transferable DRC20, instead of selecting an existing transferable batch of DRC20 assets.
