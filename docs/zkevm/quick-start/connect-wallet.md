Add the Dogechain zkEVM network of your choice to your wallet by navigating to the add network input, and enter the respective network details as given in the below table:

| Network | RPC URL | ChainID | Block Explorer URL | Currency |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Testnet | `https://rpc.testnet-cdk.dogechain.dog` | `2024115` | `https://explorer.testnet-cdk.dogechain.dog` | **ETH** |
