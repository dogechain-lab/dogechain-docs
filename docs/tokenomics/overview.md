# Community allocations breakdown - `58%`

## Ecosystem DAO fund - `29%`

The Ecosystem DAO Fund is a community-governed incentive program designed to accelerate the development of the Dogechain ecosystem. The Ecosystem DAO Fund will be used to support the applications, companies, and proposals that drive the expansion of the Dogechain ecosystem. 

Dogechain’s community governance will be launched in *Q4, 2022* with `29%` of `$DC` total supply as the ecosystem DAO fund. `$veDC` will be launched as Dogechain’s governance token which can be obtained by staking `$DC`. `$veDC` holders are able to vote on governance proposals and decide on how to spend the `29%` Ecosystem DAO Fund for a more prosperous Dogechain ecosystem. 

## Network Operations - `15%` [*4 years* linear vesting]

This portion of the supply is reserved for validation nodes and rewards distributed to users staking with them. The staking program will be launched in *Q4, 2022*. 

## Community Airdrops - `12%`

`12%` of the `$DC` total supply will be airdropped to the Dogechain community. Among that, `3%` goes to Early Shibes and `9%` goes to Loyal Shibes.

| :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| **Percentage** |                             `3%`                             |                             `9%`                             |
|  **Release**   | `15%` upfront on TGE and remaining linear monthly vesting for *12 months* | Released in *48 months*, each month’s airdrop is `15%` upfront on 1st of the next month and the rest linear vesting over the following *12 months* |
|    **Rule**    | Rewards shared among Dogechain ecosystem participants during the bridge launch till *5AM, Aug. 23rd, PDT* | Monthly rewards pool shared among DOGE holders proportionately to their daily average DOGE holdings of that month. |

### Early Shibes Airdrop - `3%`

​    Dogechain ecosystem participants whose $DOGE stayed in the ecosystem throughout the bridge launch to *5AM, Aug. 23rd, PDT* will proportionately earn them Early Shibes airdrop. `15%` of Early Shibes airdrop will be released right upon the token launch and the remaining will be released linearly throughout the remaining *12 months*. 

​    From the bridge launch to *8PM, Aug. 23rd, PDT*

`Your eligible DOGE = DOGE deposit - DOGE withdrawal`

* *For example,*

​    Amy has 100 eligible DOGE throughout the bridge launch to *5AM, Aug. 23rd, PDT*, and the total eligible DOGE amount 1 million, 

`Amy’s Early Shibes airdrop = 100 / 1,000,000 * 3% * 1,000,000,000,000`

### Loyal Shibes Airdrop - `9%`

Following the Early Shibes program, the Loyal Shibes airdrop will last for *48 months*. The `9%` total supply assigned for the Loyal Shibes airdrop program will be released over *48 months*. Every month, the airdrop will distribute `15%` of the 0.1875% upfront on 1st of the next month. The remainder will be distributed through linear vesting over the following *12 months*.

A random number of snapshots will be taken (5-15 snapshots) every month to calculate the average daily DOGE holdings of a certain wallet during that month. The 0.1875% total supply reward pool will be shared among DOGE holders proportionately.

* **For example,**

Amy has a daily average of 100 DOGE holdings for September, and the daily average DOGE holdings by the whole community for that month is 1 million, 

`Amy’s Loyalist airdrop for September = 100 / 1,000,000 * 0.20% * 1,000,000,000,000`

## Polygon Reserve - `1%` [4 years linear vesting]

1% of `$DC` total supply will be rewarded to the Polygon community to show our appreciation of their support. The Polygon Reserve has *4-year* linear vesting starting from Sep. 1st. 

## Robinhood Reserve - `1%`

This supply will be set aside for future Robinhood users who could not immediately withdraw their Doge from their wallets.
