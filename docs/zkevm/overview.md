Dogechain is powered by Dogechain team and Polygon, and now supports zkEVM.

Dogechain zkEVM is a Layer 2 network of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup scaling solution. Dogechain zkEVM uses a cryptographic primitive called a ZK proof to validate state transitions.

Dogechain zkEVM is EVM-equivalent. It supports the majority of Ethereum EIPs, precompiles, and opcodes. Developers benefit from the seamless deployment of smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets that already work on Ethereum, but in an environment with significantly lower costs.
